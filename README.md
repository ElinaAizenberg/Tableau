**Project '2020 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey'**

In 2020 Kaggle conducted an industry-wide survey to get a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning.
This project presents information about who is working with data, which tools are used by data specialists and how widely machine learning is applied in different industries.

In public you might hear a lot of misleading information about data scpecialists, for instance, interchangable usage of terms 'data scientist' and 'data engineer' or an idea that university degree is useless for data scientists. My favorite myth is about fantastic salaries of data scientists! Following dashboards will give you a better understanding of the field and variety of positions in it.

**Interactive version of all dashboards is on the [Public Tableau website](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elina2262/viz/Kagglesurvey/Story1)**
